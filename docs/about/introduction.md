# What is it ?

The **Kalisio Development Kit** (**KDK**) aims to simplify the development of web applications running on desktop or mobile devices. It is a strongly opiniated stack to build geospatial applications provided as SaaS solutions.
**KDK** is mainly powered by the following stack:
* [Feathers](https://feathersjs.com/) on the backend side
* [Quasar](https://quasar-framework.org/) on the frontend side

If you are not familiar with those technologies and want to develop for Kalisio, in addition to read the dedicated documentation, we recommand reading [https://github.com/claustres/quasar-feathers-tutorial](https://github.com/claustres/quasar-feathers-tutorial). Indeed, Kalisio template application is based on the Quasar wrapper for Feathers, while Kalisio plugins are Feathers plugins.

To get a deeper overview of some of the internals we recommand you to read our technical articles on Medium as a source of inspiration:

The Kalisio framework is also inspired by our experience in developing [Weacast](https://weacast.gitbooks.io/weacast-docs/), refering to it as a more simple project might help.
