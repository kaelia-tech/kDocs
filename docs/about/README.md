# About

The **Kalisio Development Kit** (**KDK**) aims to simplify the development of web applications running on desktop or mobile devices. It is a strongly opiniated stack to build geospatial applications provided as SaaS solutions.

Our approach is to propose a Microservice based platform. Thus each of these building blocks will have the responsibility to deliver specific and limited functionalities. Such an architectural approach plays a key role in helping us face the challenges of maintaining several mature products that need scalability within multiple contexts and include scalability in processing, storage, delivery of product features.

**KDK** is mainly powered by the following stack:
* [Feathers](https://feathersjs.com/) on the backend side
* [Quasar](https://quasar-framework.org/) on the frontend side

If you are not familiar with those technologies and want to develop for Kalisio, in addition to read the dedicated documentation, we recommend reading [https://github.com/claustres/quasar-feathers-tutorial](https://github.com/claustres/quasar-feathers-tutorial). Indeed, Kalisio template application is based on the Quasar wrapper for Feathers, while Kalisio plugins are Feathers plugins.

To get a deeper overview of some of the internals we recommend you to read our technical articles on Medium as a source of inspiration:

The Kalisio framework is also inspired by our experience in developing [Weacast](https://weacast.gitbooks.io/weacast-docs/), referring to it as a more simple project might help.
