## Why Kalisio ?

Digital tools are invading our environment, provoking significant changes in our daily lives.  It is well known, this Digital Transformation uses technologies like mobility, cloud, IoT, big data, social media.... These enablers are mainstream at this point - well understood and are already incorporated into the vast majority of organizational and I.T. modernization strategies and solution initiatives. If these technologies are traditonnally used to address business process solutions such as CRM, ERP, etc. they rarely use the geospatial dimension.    
In our opinion, designing digital infrastructure using geospatial capabilities  present a significant added value to address operational processes. Such systems could be applied in case of manufacturing execution systems, field survey management, critical infrastructure management, smart asset management, fleet management....

## Kalisio philosophy

Our approach is to propose a Microservice based platform. Thus each of these building blocks will have the responsibility to deliver specific and limited functionalities. Such an architectural approach plays a key role in helping us face the challenges of maintaining several mature products that need scalability within multiple contexts and include scalability in processing, storage, delivery of product features.

## What is inside ?
