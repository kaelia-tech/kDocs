## Map

Although some dedicated components do exist, you usually rely on provided [mixins](./mixins.md#map) to build your own map.

### Location

The **k-location-map** allows to display a location on a map using a marker.

The **k-location-field** provides you with an autocomplete address search input powered by the [geocoder service](./services.md#geocoder-service) to be embedded in a [**k-form**](../kcore/components.md#forms-and-editors).

## Globe

No dedicated component exist at the moment, you usually rely on provided [mixins](./mixins.md#globe) to build your own globe.
