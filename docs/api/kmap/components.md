# Components

## Catalog layers

The **k-layers-panel** allow to list all available layers in [catalog]() 

## 2D Map

Although some dedicated components do exist, you usually rely on provided [mixins](./mixins#3d-globe) to build your own map.

### Location

The **k-location-map** allows to display a location on a map using a marker.

The **k-location-field** provides you with an autocomplete adress search input powered by the [geocoder service](services.md#geocoder-service) to be embedded in a [**k-form**](../kcore/components#forms-and-editors)

## 3D Globe

No dedicated component exist at the moment, you usually rely on provided [mixins](./mixins#3d-globe) to build your own globe.
